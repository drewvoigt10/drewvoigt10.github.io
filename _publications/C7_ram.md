Risk stratification of therapy for pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been a focus of clinical protocol design to maximize treatment for high-risk groups while reducing therapeutic intensity for lower-risk groups. Molecular and cytogenetic markers have been used to define risk groups before therapy; however, 20% of pediatric cases lack all known markers1 and \~60% of cases lack markers that stratify outcome.2, 3 The detection of measurable residual disease (MRD) by multidimensional flow cytometry (MDF) in the remaining 'standard risk' group has permitted the stratification of patients who lack genetic abnormalities linked to therapy outcomes.4 However, discrimination between good and poor-risk groups based on the immunophenotype at diagnosis has not been sufficiently robust to routinely stratify patients. Previous reports have largely focused on the relationship between outcome and the expression of a single antigen.5 Multidimensional immunophenotypes have been reported,6, 7, 8 but none clearly identify risk cohorts. By combining the quantitative expression of multiple antigens, not just their presence or absence, we have identified a previously uncharacterized multidimensional immunophenotype in a cohort of pediatric patients from Children's Oncology Group (COG) clinical trial AAML0531. We sought to determine the clinical, biological and outcome characteristics of patients with this phenotype.
