The quantitative expression of cell surface antigens and light scattering properties of five cellular reference populations in stressed bone marrow specimens were compared between pediatric and adult patients treated for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The mean intensity of each antigen as well as the within patient and between patient variability showed striking consistency between the two different age groups. The only difference between the groups of specimens was the proportion of progenitor cells in the adult cohort averaged less than three times the proportion in the pediatric cohort. These data show that the amounts of gene products expressed on bone marrow cells are invariant with age.
