We have recently shown that the amounts of most gene products are precisely regulated during the development of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow [1,2]. Comparing the intensities of antigens (gene products) on cells of the same maturational stages, the variability within an individual exceeds that of the variability of the means between individuals. These data show that not only is the timing of appearance of gene product expression during hematopoiesis precise, but the absolute amounts of expression of most gene products are invariant from individual to individual, independent of age and marrow stress. The single antigen studied that differed from all others was CD33, which demonstrated a broad variability in quantitative expression from individual to individual even though the within patient variability was low.
