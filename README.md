# About

My name is Drew Voigt, and I am a 5th-year graduate student in the University of Iowa's Medical Scientist Training Program. This is my personal website.

**Research Interests:** I integrate molecular biology and bioinformatics to study physiology and mechanisms of disease. I am currently a [member of the Mullins/Scheetz labs](http://choroidlab.org/node/83) where I study visual diseases such as age-related macular degeneration. Currently, I am very involved in single-cell RNA sequencing studies, where I both prepare human ocular tissues for sequencing and perform the bioinformatic analyses. I have [developed software](https://github.com/drewvoigt10/cellcuratoR) to interact with single-cell RNA sequencing data and helped create the website [singlecell-eye.org](https://singlecell-eye.org).

**Personal Interests:** Outside of the lab, I enjoy playing/coaching soccer, hiking, and cooking. I am currently learning to [play chess](https://www.chess.com/member/drewski101010).
